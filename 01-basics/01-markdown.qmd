Childhood **vaccines**\
are one of the\
*great triumphs*\
of modern medicine.

Indeed, parents whose children are\
vaccinated no longer have to worry about\
their child's death or disability from:

-   whooping cough,
-   polio,
-   diphtheria,
-   hepatitis, or
-   a host of other infections.

Vaccines are the most cost-effective health\
care interventions there are. We have\
three new, extremely effective vaccines to\
roll out in developing countries:

1.  pneumonia
2.  rotavirus
3.  meningitis A
